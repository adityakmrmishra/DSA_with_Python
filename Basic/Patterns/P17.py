# The center() method is a built-in string method in Python that returns a string that is padded with a specified character (default is space) so that the original string is centered within the new string of a specified width.

# Hereâ€™s an example:

# text = 'hello'
# width = 10
# result = text.center(width)
# print(result)
# Copy
# This code will output the string '  hello   ', which has a total width of 10 characters and the original text 'hello' is centered within it.
